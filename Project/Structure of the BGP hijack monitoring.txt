Initial solution:

A. Take all ip of guard and exit relay => List /24 of these
B. We pull a BGP stream with the tool "BGPStream" (Open Source Framework)
C. We filter the BGP data with Prefixes of Guard and exit relay.
D. We do a IP to ASN mappings from Team Cymru.
E. Detecting Anymalities:
E1. Origin AS Check : We look if the BGP update is valid. If not we flag the BGP update.
E2. Analytics-based detection :
E2a. Frequency : if AS announce a prefix rarely or for the first time it is suspicious.
E2b. Time : Hijack stays a short amount of time. If it's below a threshold it's suspicious.

Add:

D. Use of Team Cymru + ROA repository
Anaytics :
- Make an order of trustness AS. Trustness AS are less suspicious to launch an attack.

How to do it:

A. IP : https://collector.torproject.org/recent/relay-descriptors/consensuses
   See if got correct amount of data : https://metrics.torproject.org/relayflags.html
B. BGPStream : https://bgpstream.caida.org/download
C. Team Cymru : https://www.team-cymru.com/IP-ASN-mapping.html
