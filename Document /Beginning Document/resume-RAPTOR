2 ways for an adversary to gain visibility into Tor traffic:
- compromising/owning enough Tor relays
- be on the forwarding path for Tor traffic

AS can easily eavesdrop on portion of all links.

3 Attacks:
- Asymetric of internet: path from client to server can be different from server to client.
It increases the chance of an AS to observe at least one direction of both communication endpoints.
- Natural churn in Internet routing. BGP paths change over time. AS can see additionnal traffic.
- BGP hijack + BGP interception attacks : exploit the inherent insecurity of internet routing.

The correlation of 2 traffic flow is done by analysing the packet timing and packet size.

asymmetric traffic analysis : novel form of end-to-end timing analysis.
=> We can correlate a flow of acknowledgment with a tcp data flow.
=> same with ack to ack 
=> same with data to data

SSL/TLS leaves the TCP header unencrypted => we look at TCP sequence number and TCP ack field.
+ correlation with the time.

Natural churn: anonymity can degrade over time: (more AS see connection when churn happend)

'' : an AS can break links to make traffics reroute to another AS that could do a correlation attack.

BGP hijack : Advertising a prefix as its own will causes a fraction of Internet traffic destined to the prefix to be captured by the adversary.

Tor guard relay is an attractive target for BGP hijack because they know client IP.

We note that in a prefix-hijack attack, the captured
traffic is blackholed, and the clientâ€™s connection to the
guard is eventually dropped.

BGP interception attack, that allows adversaries to perform exact deanonymization of Tor users without loosing the connection (no blackhole)

A prefix interception attack allows the malicious AS to become an intermediate AS in the path towards the guard relay

BGP hijack => AS Path: AS1
BGP interception => AS Path: AS1 AS2 AS3 ASorigin

BGP interception attacks can perform exact deanonymization of Tor clients
