Initial solution:

A. Take all ip of guard and exit relay => List /24 of these
B. We pull a BGP stream with the tool "BGPStream" (Open Source Framework)
C. We filter the BGP data with Prefixes of Guard and exit relay.
D. We do a IP to ASN mappings from Team Cymru.
E. Detecting Anymalities:
E1. Origin AS Check : We look if the BGP update is valid. If not we flag the BGP update.
E2. Analytics-based detection :
E2a. Frequency : if AS announce a prefix rarely or for the first time it is suspicious.
E2b. Time : Hijack stays a short amount of time. If it's below a threshold it's suspicious.

Add:

D. Use of Team Cymru + ROA repository
Anaytics :
- Make an order of trustness AS. Trustness AS are less suspicious to launch an attack.

How to do it:

A. IP : https://collector.torproject.org/recent/relay-descriptors/consensuses
   See if got correct amount of data : https://metrics.torproject.org/relayflags.html
B. BGPStream : https://bgpstream.caida.org/download
C. Team Cymru : https://www.team-cymru.com/IP-ASN-mapping.html

Hello William,

To be sure we all have the goals discussed today in mind:

The goal of this Master Thesis a tool capable of:

- Giving all relays a score to hijack resilience. This score depends on
the location of the peer connecting to the relay. The location can be at
the AS level, or/and the country level.

- We expect this tool to be able to continuously monitor the Internet
and the Tor network, and to store the information for later usage (e.g.,
processing and view on a website).

- The tool should also be able, in duality to the resilience score, to
detect live BGP anomalies. A nice to have would be classification of
those anomalies.

Because this tool computes its metrics and anomaly detection based on
third-party inputs, a precise understanding of the third-party inputs
must be demonstrated. How they are gathered, by whom? Are they trusted?
Can we defend against malicious input to the tool? All those questions
should be covered in the Master Thesis, and probably more.

Before resuming the achievement of these goals, we would like next week
to receive explanation about BGP Hijack in details, and that you can
explain to us the literature on the subject.

I hope it helps you to structure your work.

Best,

Florentin & Ramin

A score to each relay on hijack resilience : Does the AS will accept the BGP hijack (BGP update with )

BGPplay => cartographie d'internet ripe ncc
For next week => make a code to give all relays a score to hijack resilience. (When an Hijack, Internet might be split in 2 => from where it is Hijack and from where it is not)
1. with BGPStream => make a cartography of internet (Prefix + AS Path) (from the beginning) (Compare output with same type of tools that already exist)

Graph Database : NEO4j (Node = ASN); inside => LIST[Prefix]= AS PATH

How to know if AS will be resilient to hijack ? (will be an estimation) (Simulate the decision process standart) Rely on AS PATH
Do a compute on demande : AS that Update prefix hijack => what happend

% would be the portion of the AS that would be Hijack on total of AS.

=> Use all collector available
=> Make a topology of the network of AS with the AS Path received (We can know the links) + Each node contain AS Path to prefix
=> On demand : From which AS we launch a same prefix hijack, look how much AS will accept the update (we decide it by the AS Path)
